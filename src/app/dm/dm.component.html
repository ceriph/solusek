  <h1>Scenario 1 - Cursed</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Get all the characters to roll CON, and note the order. They will slowly wake up one by one.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your head pounds as you lie on the cold stone floor, ears ringing and vision black. Gradually, X, you groggily
    open your eyes as the ringing in your ears fades and in replaced by the sound of a woman screaming.
  </p>
  <p>
    You look around slowly as you sit up, gasping as the movement sends daggers of pain through your skull. You can just
    about make out the
    figure beside you, X, a /race/ also coming to, followed quickly by a /race2/ and /race3/.
  </p>
  <p>
    Along the wall next to x, is a small girl whimpering on the floor, and past her a thin middle aged man covered in
    bruises. He is pulling at the collar around his neck, which appears to be chained to the wall behind him. At this
    point you notice
    you each have a similar collar.
  </p>
  <p>
    The man is urgently trying to get to where you now realise is the source of the screaming. A middle aged though
    still
    quite pretty, woman, being dragged across the floor by two men. These men are dressed in incredibly tattered robes
    and look like normal church acolytes other than the fact that their eyes are completely black.
  </p>
  <p>
    They do not seem to be reacting to the woman as she kicks and screams, and effortlessly lift her onto a stone altar
    at the other end of the room. Just past the altar you can see what looks like a round mirror. (Robin roll an
    intelligence
    check for magical knowledge, pass reveals it as a minor rift, strong pass reveals a rift to the Fel world).
  </p>
  <p>
    Another man, shrouded in black robes, moves toward the altar with a serrated dagger, and without hesitation plunges
    the knife into the woman's chest. Her screaming stops the man next of you cries out "Oh god, oh god no..."
    hysterically
    before falling to the ground. You notice the mirror/rift behind the altar shimmering for a few seconds before the
    woman goes completely limp.
  </p>
  <p>
    The robed man moves away and the two acolytes lift the lifeless body and toss it aside onto a pile of roughly
    a dozen other corpses. They then begin walking back towards your end of the room, eyes fixed on young girl.
  </p>
  <p>
    The man notices them and starts to completely lose it. Shouting and screaming at them "Get away from her you
    monsters!", though they do not react. As
    they reach the girl and attempt to unshackle her collar, the man manages to reach one of them and grabs him
    furiously, scratching and biting.
  </p>
  <p>
    You hear the robed figure shout harshly, "Fine, bring him first before he causes more trouble!".
  </p>
  <p>
    The acolytes immediately turn to the man and one of them and again, not reacting to his attempts to fight them, they
    unshackle his collar
    and begin dragging him toward the center of the room. As they lift him onto the altar, he locks his gaze with you
    Roariuh and shouts, "Please, protect her",
    just before the robed man stabs him in the chest. The mirror/rift shimmers again and the acolytes toss the now dead
    man aside and begin walking back.
  </p>
  <p>
    At this point your senses have finally regained and you feel like you may be able to do something. You each have
    time for 1 action before the
    acolytes make it back over to the girl. /Give the players a chance to get free now, and improvise accordingly, the
    girl can die (and ends up a spirit
    in the demon) or survive and end up a companion./
  </p>

  <h3>Followup</h3>
  <p>
    There is a loud snarl from the rift and through it climbs a hulking figure ou struggle to make out. It is a mess of
    hair, scales and skin, has bat like wings and the face of a black wolf with two small horns.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the creature claws his way out of the rift, and stands up, you judge him to be about 7' tall. The rift behind him
    almost sticks
    to him, and you can tell he is struggling to not be pulled back into it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The necromancer looks toward the creature and begs "please master, help me!". The creature mutters something in a
    gutteral
    language you don't understand and leaps toward the necromancer, ripping his head clean off and drinking the blood.
  </p>
  <p>
    The creature then turns his attention on you, but can't pull far enough away from the rift to reach you. It looks
    rather annoyed, then makes a sound you assume is a chuckle, and with a claw outstretches, releases 4 tenrils of
    pure black smoke towards each of you.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the smoke hits each of you, your vision goes black and you feel an intense burning sensation on the skin of your
    chest. A few seconds later, your vision returns and the creature continues to chuckle. He then speaks, and this time
    you understand him "I'll be seeing you soon, slaves", and he then stops resisting the rift, which pulls him back
    through
    it before closing.
  </p>
  <p>
    You are left with a very odd feeling in your stomach and the lingering burning sensation on your chest.

    of unknown creatures litter the ground while hulking figures consume them. Suddenly a giant demon towers below you,
    fangs large than yourself threatening tear your limb from limb. The demon shrinks and takes the appearance of Sophea who
    walks towards you, giggling, before taking a knife and plunging it into your stomach. You awake screaming, covered
    in sweat.
  </p>

  <h2>The Enchantress (intro)</h2>
  <p>
    The tower is tall, dark and threatening, surrounded by dead trees shrouded in mist. As you approach a feeling of dread
    washes over you, every bone in your body wanting to turn and run. As you reach the tower, the image shift and suddenly
    you are looking at a tiny woodland cottage, nestled against a hill, with a wooden door about the right size for you Mordan.
    The surrounding trees are no longer dead, but vibrant and green, and you realise the feeling of dread has vanished.
  </p>
  <p>
    Upon entering the cottage, you are surprised to enter not what you expected, but what appears to be a large underground
    cavern. In the center, blocking your path is a cavern about 10 feet wide. They just have to walk across the cavern.
  </p>
  <p>
    You enter into a narrow, long room, on the far end is a wall covered in a mirror. As you approach the mirror, the reflection
    moves and begins to step out from the mirror. Each of your reflections does this.

    woman you have ever seen. Reaching about 30' even sitting down, she smiles down at you and says
    "Greeting, tiny people, I hope you enjoyed the journey here", she giggles like a child.
  </p>
  <p>
    The enchantress casts protect mind on the party, blocking the reach of the demon for some time. Directs them to return
    to Belgarath and suddenly the party find themselves outside of the tiny looking cottage.
