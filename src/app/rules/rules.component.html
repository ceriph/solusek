    <h3 id="Dice">Dice</h3>
    <p>
      Dice are a large part of roleplaying, introducing an element of randomness and excitement. The dice used will be
      standard DnD dice: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100. The most common usages of which are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>d4</b> - timers - sometimes the DM will roll a d4 to decide how long before something happens
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>d4-d12</b> - damage - used for damage rolls
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>d20</b> - checks/saving throws
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>D100</b> - percentile checks for certain conditions such as madness
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="Rounding">ROUNDING</h3>
    <p>
      When calculating a result that ends up not being a whole number, you should always round down.
    </p>

    <h3 id="Checks">CHECKS</h3>
    <p>
      When performing an arbitrary action, the character may be asked to perform a check.
    </p>
    <p>
      A check tests a character’s innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM
      calls for an ability check when a character attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance
      of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.
    </p>
    <p>
      For every ability check, the GM decides which of the six stats is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty
      of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. You will be informed of the general difficulty of the task before
      attempting to do it. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC:
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr class="header">
        <td><b>Difficulty</b></td>
        <td><b>DC</b></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Trivial</td>
        <td>5</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Easy</td>
        <td>10</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Medium</td>
        <td>20</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Hard</td>
        <td>30</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Very hard</td>
        <td>40</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Nearly impossible</td>
        <td>50+</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses
      and
      penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a
      success—the
      creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no
      progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM.

      Some checks may require teamwork (for example pushing a very large object), in this case, players can roll
      together to combine into a stronger check.
    </p>

  <div class="box">
    <h2 id="Resting">Resting</h2>
    <p>Characters can rest out of combat to gain health and refresh certain abilities. There are two types of rests:</p>

    <h3 id="ShortRest">Short Rest</h3>
    <p>
      A short rest is considered a 1 hour break that the characters can use after combat to recover health. Shorts rests
      should only be taken when the characters are not currently in any immediate danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the characters are not <b>exhausted</b>, they gain health equal to their rolled <b>hit die</b> + <b>constitution</b>
      + <b>level</b>
      and refresh all 'once per encounter' abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Characters can take 3 short rests per day before becoming <b>exhausted</b>.
    </p>

    <h3 id="LongRest">Long Rest</h3>
    <p>
      A long rest is considered a full nights sleep taking place in a prepared camp or lodgings. Characters regain all
      hit points, refresh all abilities and remove any existing <b>exhausted</b> conditions.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h2 id="Combat">Combat</h2>
    <p>
      Combat consists of the <b>Setup</b> phase, and the <b>Turns</b> phase.
    </p>
    <h3 id="Setup">Setup</h3>
    <p>
      During setup, the players and DM determine <b>surprise</b>, <b>positions</b> and <b>initiative</b>.
    </p>
    <h4 id="Surprise">Surprise</h4>
    <p>

    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h2 id="Death">DEATH</h2>
    <p>
      It <i>will</i> be possible to die, as a player it is your responsibility as players to avoid putting your
      characters in situations where death is likely. It is possible to recover from death through rare magical
      equipment or high level <b>Cleric</b> spells, but these will be unavailable for some time.
    </p>

    <h4>Dying</h4>
    <p>
      Whenever you start your turn with 0 health, you must make a special check, called a <b>death saving throw</b>, to
      determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to
      any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances
      of succeeding on a saving throw.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Roll a d20:</b> If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no
      effect by
      itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your <b>third</b> failure, you die. The successes
      and
      failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is
      reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Rolling 1 or 20:</b> When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If
      you
      roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Damage at 0 Hit Points</b>: If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw
      failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds
      your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.
    </p>
    <p>
      A character who is healed above 0 health is considered immediately conscious and no longer dying.
    </p>

    <h4>Instant Death</h4>
    <p>
      Instant death can occur when a player takes damage which would reduce them to their maximum health below 0. This
      can
      occur on any player regardless of whether they are already dying, for example if a character with 20/20 max health
      gets hit for 40 damage, they would instantly be dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this reason extra care should be taken with characters or creatures that are far more powerful than you.
      Provoking an attack from them would not be wise!
    </p>

    <h4>Stabilizing</h4>
    <p>
      When a character is stable, they are still considered unconscious and at 0 health, however they are no longer
      dying.
      Characters can be stabilised by other players through the use of bandages, and in some cases resourceful role play
      actions such as putting pressure on blood flow etc.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h2 id="CharacterAdvancement">Character Advancement</h2>
    <p>
      Characters advance in level by earning experience points. These are awarded for various actions such as defeating
      enemies in combat, completing a quest, or exceptional feats of roleplaying.
    </p>
    <p>
      When advancing in level, characters will improve their stats and unlock abilities dependant on their class. The
      general
      rule is that on even levels, the character gains a bonus stat, and on odd levels they gain a new ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      The requirements for each level are as follows:

    <h2 id="CharacterCreation">CHARACTER CREATION</h2>
    <p>
      Creating a character consists of the following steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Select a <b>Race</b></li>
      <li>Select a <b>Class</b></li>
      <li>Allocate your <b>Primary Stats</b></li>

    <h3 id="Races">RACES</h3>
    <p>
      Your race affects your appearance, how some characters judge you, and has an effect on your starting stats. Each
      race also has an additional unique passive ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some races will be slightly better suited to certain classes at the beginning, however there are no restrictions
      on this choice.

    <h3 id="Classes">CLASSES</h3>
    <p>
      Your class defines how you operate in combat, giving you access to a specific set of equipment and abilities. Each

    </p>
    <p>
      Please note the full set of class abilities is currently incomplete and will be discovered as you progress, what

    <h3 id="Stats">STATS</h3>
    <p>
      Stats are the numbers which make up a character's ability to excel (or not) at certain things. This is split up
      into <b>primary</b> stats and <b>secondary</b> stats.
    </p>

    <h4 id="Primary">PRIMARY</h4>
    <p>
      Primary stats are the building blocks of your character. At creation you will receive some base stats dependant on
      the selected <b>race</b>, and additionally you will receive 5 points (10 for humans) to spend as you like.
    </p>
    <p>
      The class you choose should guide you in which stats to allocate points in, however no matter what class you
      choose
      it is recommended to place a point or two in <b>Constitution</b> for health and <b>Agility</b> for movement.
    </p>

    <h5>Strength</h5>
    <p>
      How physically strong the character is. Allows the character to flex and lift heavy objects, as well as do more
      melee damage in combat.
    </p>

    <h5>Constitution</h5>
    <p>
      How healthy and fit the character is. Directly affects the <b>health</b> of a character as well as
      resistance to <b>poison</b> and <b>disease</b>.
    </p>

    <h5>Agility</h5>
    <p>
      How fast and coordinated the character is. Directly affects the <b>movement</b> and <b>dodge</b> ratings of a
      character.
      It also affects damage done using ranged weapons.
    </p>

    <h5>Intelligence</h5>
    <p>
      How witty and educated the character is. Directly affects the power of most <b>arcane</b>, <b>fire</b>, <b>ice</b>
      and <b>dark</b> based magic, as well as <b>resistance</b> to those.
    </p>

    <h5>Spirit</h5>
    <p>
      How in tune a character is with either their inner spirit or their god. Directly affects to power of most
      <b>light</b> and <b>energy</b> magic, as well as resistance to those.
    </p>

    <h5>Charisma</h5>
    <p>
      How charming and persuasive a character is. Directly affects the power of most <b>mind</b> magic as well as
      resistance to
      it. Also useful when trying to pick up girls.
    </p>

    <h4 id="Secondary">SECONDARY</h4>
    <p>
      Secondary stats are calculated from both the characters primary stats, level, and any item enhancements. They
      cannot be
      directly modified in the same way that the primary stats are.
    </p>

    <h5>Health</h5>
    <p>
      The general well-being of a character, health is used as an indicator of how close a character is to dieing. It is
      based
      on <b>constitution</b>, <b>level</b>, and the <b>class</b>. All characters start with health equal to:
    </p>
    <p class="code">
      Max Health = Hit Die Max + Constitution
    </p>
    <p>
      Character gain health each level based on the average of their <b>class hit die</b>. An easy way to calculate how
      much
      maximum health a character currently has is:
    </p>
    <p class="code">
      Max Health = Hit Die Max + ((Hit Die Average + Constitution) * Level)
    </p>
    <p>
      For example a level 5 Warrior (class hit die d12) with 5 Constitution, and a level 5 Wizard (class hit die d6)
      with
      3 Constitution would have:
    </p>
    <p class="code">
      Warrior = 12 + ((6 + 5) * 5) = 67 <br/>
      Wizard = 6 + ((3 + 3) * 5) = 36
    </p>
    <p>
      When a character is below 50% of their maximum health, they are considered <b>wounded</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a character is at 0 health or below, they are considered incapacitated and dying. For more detail see
      the section on <a href="rules#Death">Death</a>.
    </p>

    <h5>Temporary Health</h5>
    <p>
      Some spells and abilities grant a character temporary health, which acts as a temporary buffer against damage.
      Characters with full health can be given additional health via temporary health.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a character with temporary health takes damage, the damage is first taken from temporary health and if any is
      leftover
      it is then taken on actual health.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once temporary health is removed, it cannot be regained via healing. If a character with temporary health is
      granted
      more temporary health, they are not combined, the character must chose whether to keep their existing pool or to
      take the new one.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a character takes any sort of rest, temporary hit points are removed.
    </p>

    <h5>Movement</h5>
    <p>
      This is the characters ability to move around the battlefield in combat. Units are generally considered to be in
      meters, so a character with 5 movement is able to move 5 meters per round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Characters have movement equal to their <b>Agility</b> stat plus any modifiers. It should be noted that heavy
      armour
      and shields negatively affect a characters movement. A character will always have a minimum of 1 movement
      regardless of modifiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Movement is also used to decide combat turn order during the <b>Initiative</b> phase.
    </p>

    <h5>Avoidance</h5>
    <p>
      The characters ability to avoid attacks, and comes in two categories: <b>dodge</b> and <b>resistance</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Dodge</b> affects the characters ability to avoid physical attacks as well as some projectile based magic. To
      calculate
      a characters <b>Dodge Rating</b>, take 10 and add their <b>Agility</b>, then any other modifiers. Similar to <b>movement</b>,
      <b>dodge</b> is negatively affected by heavy armour and shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Resistance</b> affects the characters ability to avoid poison, disease and magical attacks. The stat used
      depends type of magic being
      employed and will be described on the ability/weapon.
    </p>

    <h5>Mitigation</h5>
    <p>
      The characters ability to reduce damage they taken from hits. Like avoidance this comes in two categories: <b>armour</b>
      and <b>magic reduction</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Armour</b> reduces the amount of physical damage taken and is generally improved by wearing better and heavier
      armour.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Magic Reduction</b> reduces the amount of magical damage taken and can only be improved through certain
      abilities
      and magical items. Note that if something states 'Magic reduction', it applies to all types of magical damage,
      however some
      abilities and items may only apply to certain types of magic, in this case it will be specific, such as 'Fire
      reduction'.
    </p>

    <h3 id="Additional">ADDITIONAL INFO</h3>
    <p>
      To finalise your character, you should give them some general details such as name, age, appearance, personality,
      background, and life goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the background and life goals you can be an in depth of as mysteriously vague as you wish. You do not need
      to disclose all these details with the other players, however being open with the DM allows them to mould the
      story
